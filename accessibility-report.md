# Farms Burner Accessibility Report

# 1. The Principles of Universal Design

## Principle 1: Equitable Use

- Farms Burner does a solid job of appealing to a broad base of users, as it is a video game which can be enjoyed by anyone - it does not discriminate on the basis of things like disabilities or things like race, gender etc. The User Interface of the game aims to be visually appealing for all, and there is nothing in the game that stigmatizes certain groups of people and favours others. Additionally, all players of the game have identical means of use; the controls are always the same, which shows how Farms Burner follows principle 1a specifically.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

- Farms Burner follows principles 2b, 2c and 2d, while it could do a better job of following priciple 2a. The game is easy to play regardless of one's handedness, as the keyboard controls can be easily accessed for both types of users. Also, the controls of the game allow the user to be accurate and precise in their decisions, demonstrating an effective implementation of principle 2c. Moreover, the game can be played at a relaxed pace or with more purpose, demonstrating adaptability with regards to user pace. On the topic of principle 2a, in the future we could add in things like controller support to provide more choice with regards to methods of use.

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

- Farms Burner follows principle 3 quite well, as the user inferface and experience is designed to draw attention to important features, while remaining as simple and intuitive as possible. The farm tiles are front and center in the view, with farm actions being shown at the top and bottom. Visual feedback for user actions is present, which aligns with principle 3e. One thing that we could improve upon in the future is to add support for additional languages, in order to better accomodate non-english players.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information

- At the moment, Farms Burner does a good job of following principles 4a and 4b; the game's user interface has information that is legible and easy to read, and many aspects of the user experience incorporate symbols and colour coding to differentiate elements (different icons for unclaimed, claimed, watered and fertilzed land, etc.). One way we could work on improving upon principles 4a and 4d is by adding sound effects to the game in the future, in order to provide audio feedback to those who are visually impaired.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

- Overall, this is an area where Farms Burner could see some improvements being made, as most of the actions that can be completed within the game do not necessarily provide fail safe features. One way we could make this improvement is by having a popup that appears whenever you want to spend money on a tool/tool upgrade or make a big sale, asking if you would like to confirm the action. This would prevent any accidental purchases/sales that the user did not intend on making, thereby increasing the tolerance for error that our game has.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

- Currently, Farms Burner does a relatively good job of following Principle 6, with principles 6a, 6b and 6d being followed extremely well. Playing the game can be done in a neutral body position, and does not demand a lot from the user physicality/force wise. However, something that Farms Burner suffers from is the repetitive nature of a farming simulation game, owing to the inherently repetitive nature of farming. However, we did do a reasonably good job of tackling this by creating tools that can till/water/plant/harvest/fertilize many tiles at once, which eliminates the need to click every tile of land individually.

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

- This principle is adhered to almost by default for Farms Burner, since much of this principle focuses on design in physical spaces, rather than in a virtual environment. Even in the context of Farms Burner, however, principle 7 is adhered to, with clear lines of sight to different buttons on the screen and easily reachable input components. Those with varying hand and grip size can still easily enjoy the game, and there is adequate room for the use of assistive devices when one is operating a laptop.

# 2. Marketing Farms Burner

When considering how to market Farms Burner, we would want to focus primarily on those who play and enjoy video games already, as Farms Burner is a video game itself. However, we would likely want to go beyond this general classification, as not all gamers would enjoy Farms Burner. Rather, we would be more likely to find success in targeting those who enjoy playing video games that are similar in nature to Farms Burner; slow-paced and based on farming. Individuals who enjoy games such as Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing may find Farms Burner to be right for them, while others who play games such as Grand Theft Auto or Fortnite may not be as interested. In addition to this, Farms Burner may appeal to those who do not play video games much at all, but rather have a strong interest in agriculture and farming. This would be a potentially valuable secondary group to target, as they may find the game to be a good escape from the stresses of life once in a while.

# 3. Consideration of User Demographics

After considering the implementation of Farms Burner, we concluded that there are certain demographics that are less likely to be able to successfully use our software, and as a result our program does unfortunately exacerbate some existing societal inequalities. One of the demographics that would have trouble utilizing our software successfully would be those who are visually impaired, as the lack of sound effects in Farms Burner would prevent them from having a good user experience, or even being able to have a user experience at all. In addition to this, we also concluded that individuals with dyslexia may have trouble playing our game effectively, as much of our user interface is based on written instructions and labels (we do also have a lot of symbols/visuals in our UI that help to ease this issue quite a bit, but the issue still stands).
