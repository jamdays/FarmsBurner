## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information

- At the moment, Farms Burner does a good job of following principles 4a and 4b; the game's user interface has information that is legible and easy to read, and many aspects of the user experience incorporate symbols and colour coding to differentiate elements (different icons for unclaimed, claimed, watered and fertilzed land, etc.). One way we could work on improving upon principles 4a and 4d is by adding sound effects to the game in the future, in order to provide audio feedback to those who are visually impaired.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

# 2. Marketing Farms Burner

When considering how to market Farms Burner, we would want to focus primarily on those who play and enjoy video games already, as Farms Burner is a video game itself. However, we would likely want to go beyond this general classification, as not all gamers would enjoy Farms Burner. Rather, we would be more likely to find success in targeting those who enjoy playing video games that are similar in nature to Farms Burner; slow-paced and based on farming. Individuals who enjoy games such as Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing may find Farms Burner to be right for them, while others who play games such as Grand Theft Auto or Fortnite may not be as interested. In addition to this, Farms Burner may appeal to those who do not play video games much at all, but rather have a strong interest in agriculture and farming. This would be a potentially valuable secondary group to target, as they may find the game to be a good escape from the stresses of life once in a while.
