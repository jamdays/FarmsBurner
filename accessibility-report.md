# 1. The Principles of Universal Design

## Principle 1: Equitable Use

- TODO: discuss how Farms Burner relates this principle (or why it doesn't need to)

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

- TODO: discuss how Farms Burner relates this principle (or why it doesn't need to)

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

- TODO: discuss how Farms Burner relates this principle (or why it doesn't need to)

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information

- At the moment, Farms Burner does a good job of following principles 4a and 4b; the game's user interface has information that is legible and easy to read, and many aspects of the user experience incorporate symbols and colour coding to differentiate elements (different icons for unclaimed, claimed, watered and fertilzed land, etc.). One way we could work on improving upon principles 4a and 4d is by adding sound effects to the game in the future, in order to provide audio feedback to those who are visually impaired.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

# 2. Marketing Farms Burner

When considering how to market Farms Burner, we would want to focus primarily on those who play and enjoy video games already, as Farms Burner is a video game itself. However, we would likely want to go beyond this general classification, as not all gamers would enjoy Farms Burner. Rather, we would be more likely to find success in targeting those who enjoy playing video games that are similar in nature to Farms Burner; slow-paced and based on farming. Individuals who enjoy games such as Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing may find Farms Burner to be right for them, while others who play games such as Grand Theft Auto or Fortnite may not be as interested. In addition to this, Farms Burner may appeal to those who do not play video games much at all, but rather have a strong interest in agriculture and farming. This would be a potentially valuable secondary group to target, as they may find the game to be a good escape from the stresses of life once in a while.

# 3. Consideration of User Demographics

After considering the implementation of Farms Burner, we concluded that there are certain demographics that are less likely to be able to successfully use our software, and as a result our program does unfortunately exacerbate some existing societal inequalities. One of the demographics that would have trouble utilizing our software successfully would be those who are visually impaired, as the lack of sound effects in Farms Burner would prevent them from having a good user experience, or even being able to have a user experience at all. In addition to this, we also concluded that individuals with dyslexia may have trouble playing our game effectively, as much of our user interface is based on written instructions and labels (we do also have a lot of symbols/visuals in our UI that help to ease this issue quite a bit, but the issue still stands).
