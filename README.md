## User story

- Aayush is bored because his test starts at 1pm and it is only 12pm. He decides to finally play his new game Farms Burner. He plants some of his crops. Then water them. He checks the time and realizes that he was wrong! His test is at 12 and heâ€™s already wasted 10 mins!
- Aayush finally got back from his test (he failed), but to cheer himself up he decides to enjoy the Calgary weather in his new favorite game, Farms Burner. It is nighttime now, and raining slightly in Calgary. The plants on his farm get a growth boost for a while and the ground is softer so he can plant more crops that day. But since it is night none of his farm vehicles work. So after planting his seeds, he logs off for the day, saving his progress for next time!
- Aayush wakes up the next day and is feeling hungry,ðŸ«„ so instead of talking about it he goes and eats some breakfast ðŸ˜‹. While he is sitting down to eat breakfast, he decides to check on his Farms Burner, some of his crops have grown! They look so good he wishes he could eat themðŸ˜‹ (he is hungry ðŸ«„). It is a cloudy day in Calgary, so he only has limited power, he uses his power to process his crops and gain some points. He canâ€™t process all his crops because of the limited power, but he still has enough points to upgrade one vehicle. He upgrades his processor so he can process even more crops tomorrow. He logs off and saves his progress for later.
- Aayush just deleted Clash Royale from his phone because he was losing way too much. After losing that badly and that often he needs a calming break, he feels like the Flames ðŸ”¥. So he decides to open up his favorite game, Farms Burner! He just saw a text from his parents that it already snowed in Calgary, and canâ€™t wait to see his snowy farm and crops. Everything looks so white and beautiful! A couple of his small crops die from the snow, but his storages last a couple days longer because of the cold weather. The people of Calgary are willing to pay more for his crops in the cold weather so he processes what he can and sells it for the extra points! Then he logs off and saves his progress.
- Aayush, visiting Calgary for reading week, sees that there is a thunderstorm, he quickly hops off from duos to check on his farm. A couple of his crops died to the storm but he gets infinite power and harvests and plants as many crops as he can with his fully upgraded crop planting machine. He logs off and saves his progress, waiting until a snowy day to sell his crops, for the extra points.
