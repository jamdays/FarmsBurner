## About

### Overview

Farms Burner is an idle farming game in which the in-game weather is dependent on real world weather data, based on a user-chosen location.

### What does Farms Burner do?

- In Farms Burner, players get the full farming simulation game experience
- Choose a starting city to base your in-game weather off of
- Till open grassland, and plant numerous different types of crops on these tilled areas
- Water and fertilize your crops, and log off to give them ample time to grow and mature
- Harvest and sell matured crops, earning BarnBucks that can be used to buy powerful farming tools
- Use these tools to make your farm more efficient, and develop your Agro-Empire! 

### Why was Farms Burner created?

- As a video game, Farms Burner was ultimately created for the purposes of user enjoyment 
- We wanted to craft an overall experience that captures the comfort of an idle farming sim, while also being innovative through features like incorporating real world weather data
- We hope that users of Farms Burner find the game satisfying and rewarding to play, and a good (but temporary, don't get addicted) escape from the perils of the modern day world

### What problem does Farms Burner solve? Is Farms Burner right for me?

- Although many farming games exist on the market today, none of them incorporate real world weather data in their gameplay
- The experience of playing Farms Burner is one that allows for the lines between the virtual and physical world to be blurred
- Farms Burner is right for users who want the experience of starting a farm in their hometown, but don't actually have the ridiculous sums of money required to buy any sort of property these days
- Moreover, the game is great for players who want to experience what different climates are like through the comfort of their own home (and once again without spending ridiculous amounts of money to travel)
